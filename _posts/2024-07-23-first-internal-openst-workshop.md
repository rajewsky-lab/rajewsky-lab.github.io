We are excited to organize our first internal Open-ST workshop! Colleagues from both the wet
and the dry lab came together to discuss and learn how to process Open-ST datasets.
Our aim is to teach everyone interested in learning how to analyze this kind of data,
regardless of the level of computational expertise.

Ultimately, we are going to offer Open-ST workshops outside of our lab. We are still
thinking about the right format for this, but if you are interested in participating
then feel free to reach out!
