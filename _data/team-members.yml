  description: My PhD focuses on applying high-resolution sequencing technologies to tumors like neuroblastoma and melanoma to understand their complex ecosystems. Tumors comprise diverse cell types and are influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which impacts treatment resistance and metastasis. While single-cell RNA sequencing identifies cell populations, it lacks spatial context, which is addressed by high-resolution spatial transcriptomics. This approach allows us to study cellular interactions and malignant states within the TME, potentially leading to new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. By investigating neuroblastoma and melanoma samples, our research aims to enhance understanding of the TME and improve treatment outcomes.

  description: "Cdr1as is a circular RNA highly expressed in the brain, particularly in excitatory neurons. 
                It is involved in a tightly regulated non-coding RNA network, interacting directly 
                with miR-7. Recent studies have shown that, in mouse cortical neurons, Cdr1as buffers 
                miR-7 activity to control glutamatergic transmission and neuronal network connectivity, 
                which are crucial for long-lasting synaptic adaptations. Furthermore, Cdr1as expression 
                was susceptible to external stressors, such as ischemia and sustained depolarization, 
                subsequently affecting the regulation of glutamate release. These findings suggest that 
                the circRNA might play a crucial role in activity-dependent gene regulation and activity-related 
                disorders, such as epilepsy.

                Although this network is conserved among mammals, there has been no research into its 
                function in human model systems. Therefore, our study aims to examine the network regulation in 
                human iPSC-derived neurons and forebrain organoids. We generated human CDR1as knockout iPSC 
                lines to investigate the consequences of perturbation of this regulatory network in human 
                brain development and neuronal function. Using our model systems, we analysed the expression 
                patterns of the network during organoid development using transcriptomics, and studied the 
                effects on neuronal activity using electrophysiology. Additionally, we seek to understand 
                the molecular mechanism through which the network controls glutamatergic release and 
                comprehend the consequences of this regulatory network in seizure progression with an in 
                vitro experimental epilepsy model."

  description: I employ my extensive experience in NGS data analysis and background in physics and computational biology to help dissect single cell, spatial, and bulk sequencing data of various flavors to better understand the biology of human diseases. My focus lies on pediatric cancers which are often characterized by relatively low mutational burden and reactivation of embryonic developmental programs, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for therapeutic interventions. I work as bioinformatic coordinator for the pediatric oncology department of the Charité, where I support collaborations between Charité and BIMSB and work closely with the CUBI team at BIH.
